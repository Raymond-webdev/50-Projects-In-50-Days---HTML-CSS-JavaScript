## Welcome

- So this course is really meant for beginners or intermediate level web developers that want a cool, unique project to do every day. And these are just HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
There's no front end frameworks used or anything like that, and they're really meant to sharpen your CSS skills, your JavaScript skills, and just working with the DOM in general but like I said, they're really meant to sharpen your skills and just give you something fun to create. So if that sounds good, then let's go ahead and jump in and get started.
