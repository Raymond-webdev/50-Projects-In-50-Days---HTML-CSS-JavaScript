## Project intro

- So this is going to be one of the shortest projects in this course, but it's a cool little widget that you can add to your website or to your application. 
- It's a hidden search, and we just have this button here with a little search icon from font and as soon as I click it, it fires off a JavaScript event that activates a specific class where we add a transition for the width of this input to get wider and the button to move over using a transform. Translate X and if I click it again it's going to shrink back up. So we'll be using CSS transitions along with just a little bit of JavaScript to add the event and toggle the class. All right, so let's get started.
