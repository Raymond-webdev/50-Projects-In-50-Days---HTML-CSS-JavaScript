## project Intro

- So in this project, we're going to build some expanding cards. Basically, we were going to style these panels to have a background image and a heading. We're going to use Flexbox to align everything and then add a little bit of JavaScript so that when we click one of these, it changes the class to active and it then expands with a CSS transition. So we'll be using JavaScript for the event. Listeners will be using CSS transitions to give it the smooth through the effect. You'll see the heading doesn't come in until the card is fully expanded as well and we're using just background images and headings.
