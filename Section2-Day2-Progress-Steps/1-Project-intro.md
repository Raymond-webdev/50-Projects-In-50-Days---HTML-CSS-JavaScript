## project intro

- So in this project, we're going to build some **progress steps** and you might see these in different kinds of websites with forms multi basically like multi level forms, shopping carts, things like that. Just a progress bar that starts at one and just goes along here. So we're not going to have any form or anything, but we'll have these buttons to control the steps. So it starts at one and if I click next, then it goes to two. 
- So the line we get transition goes over to two to border lights up and when we get to the last one, the next is disabled. So we can just go back and forth. And if we're at the end disabled, if we're at the end here, then next is disabled. 
- So we'll start off with the HTML style, style it with CSS and then we'll add the functionality with JavaScript.
