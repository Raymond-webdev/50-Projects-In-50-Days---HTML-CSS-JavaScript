## Project intro

- So in this project we just have a simple article. This could be anything at all, any website, any blog and at the top left corner we have the little navigation icon.
-So if I click on that icon, what's going to happen is it actually rotates the entire website, the entire container , and then it brings in the NAV , the navigation items from the side and the icon also changes.
- So basically we have two icons open and close. We're going to position them so that when we click it, this circle rotates and shows the close button. 
- we need a little bit of JavaScript to be able to add and remove the specific class, which we're going to call **showNav** and that will rotate and bring the menu in.
